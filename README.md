# The Django Quotes App

This is a simple Django-powered web application (backend) that displays inspirational quotes, allows users to like, comment, and search for quotes. It includes a user interface for viewing quotes, an admin interface for managing quotes, and a REST API using Django REST Framework for interacting with quotes programmatically.

## Live Deployment

You can view the live deployment of this project [here](https://django-quote-application.onrender.com).

The Django backend is deployed on Render, and the UI is composed of HTML and CSS templates, which are served statically. There is no "real frontend" used in this project, so you can create your own frontend using JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

*   Python (3.7+)
*   Django (4.x)
*   Django REST Framework
*   Virtual Python Environment (recommended)
*   Git

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:** Clone the repository using the Code button in the repository's main GitHub page.

2.  **Create a virtual environment (optional):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Apply migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4. **Create a superuser (for admin access):**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

5. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    # Run the server
    python manage.py runserver
    # Go to the admin interface (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)
    # Create quotes and add them to different categories
    # Go to the homepage to see the quotes (http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
    ```
   
**Important**: Remember to change the Django production secret key and set `DEBUG` to `True` in `QuotesApp/settings.py` order to run the server:
```python
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'

DEBUG = True
```

## User Guide

## REST API Usage

The app also includes a REST API built with Django REST Framework. Here are some of the available endpoints:

| Endpoint                           | Method | Description                        | Authentication Required |
|:-----------------------------------|:------:|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------:|
| `/api/quotes/`                     |  GET   | Get a list of all quotes.          |           No            |
| `/api/quotes/<id>/`                |  GET   | Get a specific quote by ID.        |           No            |
| `/api/quotes/`                     |  POST  | Create a new quote.                |           Yes           |
| `/api/quotes/<id>/`                |  PUT   | Update a specific quote.           |           Yes           |
| `/api/quotes/<id>/`                | DELETE | Delete a specific quote.           |           Yes           |
| `/api/quotes/<quote_id>/comments/` |  GET   | Get comments for a specific quote. |           No            |
| `/api/quotes/<quote_id>/comments/` |  POST  | Add a comment to a specific quote. |           Yes           |

**Example Usage (with curl):**

```bash
# Get all quotes
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/quotes/

# Get a specific quote
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/quotes/1/
```

For example, running `curl http://127.0.0.1:800/api/quotes/` will return this output:

```json
[{"id":1,"text":"heheheheh","author":"hehe","category":"General","like_set":[]},{"id":2,"text":"ggegegege","author":"gegegeg","category":"Inspirational","like_set":[23]}]       
```

You can also go to the API endpoints directly in your browser to see the JSON responses, such as:

<p align="center" style="cursor: pointer">
    <img src="readme-images/api.png" alt="User Interface 5" style="border-radius: 10px" width="100%"/>
</p>

**Authentication:**

For endpoints that require authentication, you'll need to include an authorization token (e.g., JWT) in the request headers. You can obtain this token by implementing a login/authentication system in your Django app.

**API Development:**

To get started on developing and customizing this app's APIs, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install djangorestframework
```

Then, Add DRF to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... existing apps
    'rest_framework',
]
```
